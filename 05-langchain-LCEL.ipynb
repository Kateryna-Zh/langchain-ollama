      "Construction of the Eiffel Tower began in January 1887 and took approximately two years to complete. The tower was officially opened on March 31, 1889, and was initially intended to be a temporary structure. However, it became an instant symbol of Paris and France, and its popularity endured long after the World's Fair.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Eiffel Tower stands at an impressive 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, making it one of the tallest structures in the world at the time of its construction. The tower is supported by four main pillars and is held together by over 2.5 million rivets. Its distinctive lattice design allows for maximum strength while minimizing weight.\n",

      "* The Eiffel Tower was originally intended to be painted brown, but it was later repainted in the iconic red color that we see today.\n",
